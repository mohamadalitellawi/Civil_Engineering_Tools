    "# Python.Net Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The .NET interface is the most modern way to connect to the CSi API and is the method I recommend. If you want to connect to a remote instance of SAP2000 over a network, it is the only interface that offers this feature. It has additional benefits such as fully populated Python function signatures that you can access in JupyterLab by using `.[Tab]` and `[Shift]-[Tab]`. This means that you do not constantly need to have the API documentation open in a separate window.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is slightly fussier to user the Python.NET interface but I think that the benefits are certainly worth it!"

    "## Connecting to SAP2000 using Python.NET\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CSi PythonNET Example code](CSI_PythonNET_Example.py) shows several ways of connecting to the software. I have broken apart the example here and shown each way as an independent code example. You can basically copy/paste any one of these into your functions and use this as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regardless of which software you are using, the DLL file should still be called \"SAP2000v2.dll\"\n",
    "* You don't have to use the name `sap_namespace` like I use. I am simply calling it that so it is clear to you that it is the \"SAP top-level namespace\". You could call it simply `sap`, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the example docs, they do this: `from SAP2000v1 import *`. While this \"works\", I would strongly recommend that you DO NOT DO THIS. Why? Because this will pull ALL of the function names in the top-level SAP namespace into the top-level namespace of your Jupyter notebook. While this may _seem_ convenient, it makes it very difficult to understand where objects come from (did I define it in my notebook or was it imported from the \"star import\"?). It also makes it so you CANNOT use `.[Tab]` to discover the names of all the functions. The two ways for you to see the function names are as follows:\n",
    "> * Execute `print(globals())` to see the value of ALL variables in your namespace\n",
    "> * Look at the Variable Inspector in the debugger\n",
    "> As you will see (if you do this) there are a LOT of variable names now filling up your top-level namespace. The process of using \"star imports\" has the effect of \"polluting your namespace\" with all sorts of names that you probably are not using (and now _cannot_ use because they are already defined as variable names; if you use the same name after the fact, you over-write the data contained in the variable after the import).\n",
    "> Doing \"star imports\" is all kinds of bad news. I do not even teach it in the course because it is such bad practice. Nobody encourages its use. I recommend you do what I do and start rolling your eyes any time you read code that uses \"star imports\" (lol).\n"
