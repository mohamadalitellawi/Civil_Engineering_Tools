# Civil_Engineering_Tools
#### Date 28-Jun-2024

### Introduction
This is under construction app collecting some useful tools for civil engineering that are needed regularly in the daily tasks for a civil engineer.

There is no intent to be a full set of tools or as a replacement for some useful commercial softwares in the civil engineering eco system (Prokon, STEPS, TEDDS, ...).

Most of the tools will be built by Python Programing language and following the American standards mostly with metric units.
